# 15+ Years of Engineering Quality & Customer Trust

I am a **Quality Strategist** dedicated to building resilient software systems that earn and keep customer trust. With over 15 years of experience across the software lifecycle, I specialize in the intersection of **technical scalability** and the **Voice of the Customer (VoC)**.

I believe that true quality isn't found in a bug report—it is reflected in the confidence a user feels when they interact with a product. My approach is rooted in the belief that quality is a strategic engineering attribute that must be **data-driven** and **scalable** to meet the demands of modern business.

### My Strategic Principles:
* **Customer-Centric Quality:** Bridging the gap between engineering requirements and the **Voice of the Customer** to ensure we build what truly matters.
* **Data-Driven Excellence:** Moving beyond intuition by leveraging **metrics and observability** to prove system stability and product performance.
* **Scalable Guardrails:** Architecting the frameworks that allow teams to scale rapidly without compromising the **Customer Trust** we’ve worked hard to build.
* **The Full-Circle Evolution:** Guiding organizations through the shift toward shared ownership, where quality is baked into the code from day one.

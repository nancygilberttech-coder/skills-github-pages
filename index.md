## 15+ Years of Engineering Quality & Customer Trust
### Hi there, I'm Nancy! 👋

### 🚀 What Drives Me
I am a **QA Strategist and Program Manager** dedicated to building and delivering resiliency software systems that earn customer trust and excite customers. With over 15+ years of experience across software lifecycle, I specialize in the intersection of **technical scalability** and  being the ""Voice of the Customer (VoC)** driving business solutions.

I believe that true quality isn't found in a bug report—it is reflected in the confidence a user feels when they interact with a product. My approach is rooted in the belief that quality is a strategic engineering attribute that must be **data-driven** and **scalable** to meet the demands of modern business.

My mission for 2026 is to master complex architectures, share and involve in technical discussions/forums while maintaining a balanced, healthy lifestyle. I believe that consistency in small habits—like daily 3L of water or a 15-minute walk—is the foundation for solving the hardest engineering problems.

### My Strategic Principles:
* **Customer-Centric Quality:** Bridging the gap between engineering requirements and the **Voice of the Customer** to ensure we build what truly matters.
* **Data-Driven Excellence:** Moving beyond intuition by leveraging **metrics and observability** to prove system stability and product performance.
* **Scalable Guardrails:** Architecting the frameworks that allow teams to scale rapidly without compromising the **Customer Trust** we’ve worked hard to build.
* **Quality As a culture:** Guiding organizations through the shift toward shared ownership, where quality is baked into the code from day one.
